## Cross-Validation Algorithm Test Harness
Cross-validation is a resampling technique that provides more reliable estimates of algorithm
performance on unseen data. It requires the creation and evaluation of k models on different
subsets of your data, and as such is more computationally expensive. Nevertheless, it is the
gold standard for evaluating machine learning algorithms

Although slightly more complex in code and slower to run, this function provides a more
robust estimate of algorithm performance. We can tie all of this together with a complete
example on the diabetes dataset with the Zero Rule algorithm.

A total of 5 cross-validation folds are used to evaluate the Zero Rule Algorithm. As such,
5 scores are returned from the evaluate algorithm() algorithm. Running this example both
prints these list of scores calculated and prints the mean score.
